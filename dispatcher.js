/**
 * The dispatcher needs to know two things - actions and stores.
 * The actions are simply forwarded to the stores so we donâ€™t necessarily
 * have to keep them. The stores, however, should be tracked inside
 * the dispatcher so we can loop through them.
 *
 * It acts as a hub for all the events in the system. Its job is to receive
 * notifications that we call actions and pass them to all the stores.
 * The store decides if it is interesting or not and reacts by changing its
 * internal state/data. That change is triggering re-rendering of the views
 * which are (in our case) React components.
